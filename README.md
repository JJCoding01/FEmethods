## Introduction
_FEmethods_ is a python module that uses Finite Element Methods to determine the
reactions, and plot the shear, moment, and deflection along the length of a beam.

Using Finite elements has the advantage over using exact solutions because it 
can be used as a general analysis, and can analyze beams that are statically 
indeterminate. The downside of this numerical approach is it will be less 
accurate than the exact approach.

The official documentation is on [Read the Docs](https://femethods.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

## Installation

__FEMethods__ is hosted on PyPi, so installation is simple.

`pip install femethods`


## General Layout

`FEMethods` is made up of several sub-classes to make it easy to define loads
and reaction types.

### femethods.loads
There are currently only two different load types that are implemented.

 * `PointLoad`, a normal force acting with a constant magnitude on a single point
 * `MomentLoad`, a rotational moment acting with a constant magnitude acting at a single point

All loads are defined by a `location` along the element, and a `magnitude`. 
The `location` must be positive, and must lie on the length of the beam,
or it will raise a `ValueError`

_Future goals are to add a library of standard distributed loads 
(constant, ramp, etc) as well as functionality that will allow a distributed 
load function to be the input._

#### femethods.loads.PointLoad
The `PointLoad` class describes a standard point load. A normal load acting at
a single point with a constant value. It is defined with a location and a 
magnitude.

```python
>>> PointLoad(-10, 5)
PointLoad(magnitude=-10, location=5)
```

The `location` must be a positive value, and less than or equal to the length
of the beam, otherwise it raise a `ValueError`.

#### femethods.loads.MomentLoad
A `MomentLoad` class describes a standard moment load. A moment acting at a 
single point with a constant value. It is defined with a location and a value.

```python
>>> MomentLoad(2, 5)
MomentLoad(magnitude=2, location=5)
```

The `location` must be a positive value, and less than or equal to the length
of the beam, otherwise it raise a `ValueError`.

### femethods.reactions

There are two different reactions that can be used to support an element.

  * `FixedReaction` does not allow vertical or rotational displacement
  * `PinnedReaction` does not allow vertical displacement but does allow rotational displacement

All reactions have two properties, a `force` and a `moment`. They represent
the numerical value for the resistive force or moment acting on the element 
to support the load(s). These properties are set to `None` when the reaction 
is instantiated (ie, they are unknown). They are calculated and set when 
analyzing a element. Note that the `moment` property of a `PinnedReaction` 
will always be `None` because it does not resist a moment.

The `value` property is a read-only combination of the `force` and `moment` 
properties, and is in the form `value = (force, moment)`

All reactions have an `invalidate` method that will set the `force` and
`moment` back to `None`. This is useful when changing parameters and the
 calculated reactions are no longer valid.

#### femethods.reactions.FixedReaction
The `FixedReaction` is a reaction class that prevents both vertical and angular
(rotational displacement). It has boundary conditions of `bc = (0, 0)`

```python
>>> FixedReaction(3)
FixedReaction(location=3)

>>> print(FixedReaction(3))
FixedReaction
  Location: 3
     Force: None
    Moment: None
```

The `location` must be a positive value, and less than or equal to the length
of the beam, otherwise it raise a `ValueError`.

#### femethods.reactions.PinnedReaction
The `PinnedReaction` is a reaction class that prevents vertical displacement, 
but allows angular (rotational) displacement. It has boundary conditions of `bc = (0, None)`

```python
>>> PinnedReaction(7)
PinnedReaction(location=7)
>>> print(PinnedReaction(7))
PinnedReaction
  Location: 7
     Force: None
    Moment: None
```

The `location` must be a positive value, and less than or equal to the length
of the beam, otherwise it raise a `ValueError`.

### femethods.elements.Beam
Defines a beam as a finite element. This class will handle the bulk of the 
analysis, populating properties (such as meshing and values for the reactions).

To create a `Beam` object, write the following:

```python
b = Beam(length, loads, reactions, E=1, Ixx=1)
```

Where the loads and reactions are a list of `loads` and `reactions` respectively.

**Note**
Loads and reactions must be a list, even when there is only one.

 The `E` and `Ixx` parameters are Young's modulus and the polar moment of 
 inertia about the bending axis. They both default to `1`.

## Examples

This section contains several different examples of how to use the beam 
element, and their results.

For all examples, the following have been imported:

```python
from femethods.elements import Beam
from femethods.reactions import FixedReaction, PinnedReaction
from femethods.loads import PointLoad, MomentLoad
```

### Example 1: Cantilevered Beam with Fixed Support and End Loading

```python
beam_len = 10
# Note that both the reaction and load are both lists. They must always be
# given to Beam as a list,
r = [FixedReaction(0)]                            # define reactions as list
p = [PointLoad(magnitude=-2, location=beam_len)]  # define loads as list

b = Beam(beam_len, loads=p, reactions=r, E=29e6, Ixx=125)

# an explicit solve is required to calculate the reaction values
b.solve()
print(b)
```

The output of the program is
```

Young's Modulus (E): 29000000.0

```

### Example 2: Cantilevered Beam with 3 Pinned Supports and End Loading

```python
beam_len = 10

# Note that both the reaction and load are both lists. They must always be
# given to Beam as a list,
r = [PinnedReaction(0), PinnedReaction(2), PinnedReaction(6)]  # define reactions
p = [PointLoad(magnitude=-2, location=beam_len)]               # define loads

b = Beam(beam_len, loads=p, reactions=r, E=29e6, Ixx=125)

# an explicit solve is required to calculate the reaction values
b.solve()
print(b)
```

The output of the program is
